# arkusia

## About
Adventure Learning Game build on Java and JavaFx.

## How to build
You can build the application yourself by checking out the code and running ```mvn``` or if you have no Maven installed use ```./mvnw```on Linux or Mac and ```mvnw.cmd```on Windows. 

## How to run
If you prefer to work on the sources run ```mvn javafx:run```. You can build your own Java archive using ```mvn clean install``` and then execute ```java -jar target/arkusia-ui-1.0.0.jar```.

Alternatively download the respective release and run ```java -jar arkusia-ui-1.0.0.jar```. Please change the release version accordingly. If you are not too keen on the command line you can always right click on the file and execute it by opening it with a JDK Runtime if that is installed on your computer.
